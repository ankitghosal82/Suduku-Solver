## 🚀 Features

- Interactive 9x9 grid for puzzle input
- One-click solving using a recursive backtracking algorithm
- Clearly styled output with:
  - Original clues in **black**
  - Computed values in **bold blue**
- Works directly in your browser – no need for frontend code




### Step 1: **Project Idea**

Create a Sudoku solver app that lets users input puzzles and get solutions instantly. It also can generate new Sudoku puzzles with different difficulty levels.

---

### Step 2: **Divide Your Code into Two Parts**

* One part handles the Sudoku logic: solving puzzles, generating full Sudoku boards, removing cells to create a puzzle, and estimating difficulty.
* The other part builds the user interface (UI), where users can interact with the Sudoku grid through a web app.

---

### Step 3: **Sudoku Logic Module**

Write all the Sudoku-solving algorithms and helper functions in a separate file (module). This makes your code organized and reusable.

---

### Step 4: **User Interface Module**

Create the main app file that loads the Sudoku logic module and uses a tool like Streamlit to create an interactive web interface.

---

### Step 5: **File Organization**

Place both files in the same folder so the main app can easily import the Sudoku logic code.

---

### Step 6: **Running the App**

From your command line or terminal, navigate to your project folder and run the app. It should open in a web browser where users can enter puzzles and see solutions.

---

### Step 7: **Common Issues to Watch For**

* Make sure file names are spelled correctly.
* Ensure you run the app from the folder where your files live.
* If the app can’t find the logic module, check if the Sudoku logic file exists in the right place.

---

### Step 8: **Improving the Project**

Add more features like showing step-by-step solving, generating puzzles with selectable difficulty, and tracking user statistics to make the app more engaging and professional.

---

### Conclusion:

By separating Sudoku logic from the user interface and organizing your files properly, you build a clean, maintainable Sudoku solver app. This approach helps you easily extend functionality and prepare a project that impresses in interviews.
